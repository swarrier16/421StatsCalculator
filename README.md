[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/swarrier16/421StatsCalculator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/swarrier16/421StatsCalculator)

This project contains a statistics calculator, as well as a basic calculator. This calculator can:

1. Create random int and decimals with and without seeds
2. Create lists of random numbers
3. Select random numbers from a list with and without a seed

It can also perform these descriptive functions: 
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Mode
4. Variance
5. Standard Deviation
6. Quartiles
7. Skewness
8. Sample Correlation
9. Population Correlation
10. Z-Score
11. Mean Deviation / Mean Absolute Deviation

These are the population functions it can perform: 
1. Simple random sampling
2. Systematic sampling
3. Confidence Interval For a Sample
4. Margin of Error
5. How to Find a Confidence Interval
6. Cochranâ€™s Sample Size Formula
7. How to Find a Sample Size Given a Confidence Interval and Width (unknown population standard deviation)
8. How to Find a Sample Size Given a Confidence Interval and Width (known population standard deviation)
